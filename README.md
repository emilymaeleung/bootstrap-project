# bootstrap-project

As part of this assignment, I had to code a website in bootstrap.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and found that using Bootstrap was at first difficult, but then helped to speed up my workflow and less time spent coding elements in html/css.

What I struggled with for this project was getting content to take up the desired max-width. In last week's excersise, I could determine the site width more easily. But this week, I felt like I was working within Bootstrap's constraints - which ended up being both productive and a hinderence. 

I utilised several components from Bootstrap's library for this project: 
    - the navbar
    - the primary button 
    - the cards
    - the footer

I will definitly be implementing Bootstrap in my future projects!
